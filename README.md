# tic_tac_toe_game
Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3*3 grid
This Python project implements a classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid, aiming to align three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The program tracks the game's progress, identifies the winner, handles ties, and provides an option to restart the game. It features interactive buttons for player moves and a restart button for game reset. The code employs dictionaries to represent the game board and winning combinations, along with functions to manage player moves, check for winners, handle ties, disable buttons, and restart the game. Through this project, developers can explore GUI development in Python and reinforce concepts like event-driven programming, GUI layout, and game logic implementation.
